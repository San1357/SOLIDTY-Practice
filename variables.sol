VARIABLES : 
    3 types:

1- state variables
2- Local variables
3- Global variables 

1- state variables- values permanently stored in contract storage.

2- Local variables-  value present till function is executing.

3- Global variables- kind of special variable which already exist in workspace & provide info 
                     about blockchain & transaction process.

                     example- msg.sender, msg.value, now etc.



--> Rules of declaring Variables in Solidity :

 * same Rules which have been followed in variables declaring in python.

 1 state variable :
                |
                |--- Public
                |
                |
                |--- Private
                |
                |
                |--- Internal
                |
